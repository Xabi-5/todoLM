        Monarchy, Republic and Rise

        According to the legend, two babies were found by a wolf and fed by them until they could live for themselves. Those babies were Romulus and Remus,
        the former being the founder of the city.
        For the next 244 years it would be a monarchy, and would get 7 kings over its lifetime. In 509 BCE, the roman populace expelled the king and established
        an oligarchic Republic. During this period, Rome would grow into a mediterranean superpower, and would go on to defeat its rival, Carthage, in
        the Punic Wars, of which there were three and Rome won all of them. It would end with the murder of Julius Caesar

    <h2>
        Empire and demise
    </h2>
    <p>
        Following Julius Caesar's death and a civil war, Augustus took charge of Rome and made it an Empire. This stage was very extense and irregular.
        It saw the maximum expansion of the Roman borders, but also frequent periods of inestability. Rome would also peak in population at over a million people,
        making it the largest city on earth. But shortly afterwards, it would begin to decline, ending in the capital switch to Constantinople, taking away
        the spot Rome used to occupy, the divide of the empire in two and frequent barbarian raids

    <h2>
        Middle ages to the Present
    </h2>
    <p>
       In the early medieval period, the religion of Rome would change to christianism, and it would see the rise of the church, religious buildings
       built, and the city would change hands between other nations frequently. Approaching the 15th century, the papacy would return to Rome after 
       a period in Avignon. The old basilica of Saint Peter's would be demolished and a new one built, in which Michelangelo played an essential role.
       By the 19th century, a strong sense of national identity had grown in Italy, and under king Vittorio Emanuele II and general Garibaldi, the 
       whole peninsula would be unified in 1870, when Rome was captured. In the 20th century, Mussolini would march on the city with his black shirts,
       become dictator, give the church an independent country (The Vatican) and partake in the second World War. Finally, in 1945 Italy would become the 
       republic we know today, and later in the century join the European Union.
